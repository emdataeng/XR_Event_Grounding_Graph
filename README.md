# XR_Event-Grounding Graph

A sensor-log-first pipeline that turns **Meta Quest 3 RGB-D + pose captures** into a queryable **Event-Grounded Graph (EGG)** — tracking what objects appeared, moved, and were interacted with across a recording session. An **assembly reasoning layer** then infers industrial operation steps, workflow phases, and symbolic assembly state from the same data. Results are exported to Neo4j for graph queries.

```
Quest 3 capture → object detection → 3D tracks → events → EGG graph
                                                         → assembly reasoning → Neo4j
```

## Overview

The pipeline has two layers:

### Base layer — perception and events

1. **Detect** — Grounding DINO, MM-Grounding-DINO, or YOLOv8 detects objects in each RGB frame using a configurable text prompt or vocabulary
2. **Backproject** — Bounding box centres are projected into 3D world space using depth maps and camera pose
3. **Track** — Observations are linked across frames into persistent object tracks using spatial + class similarity
4. **Detect events** — Tracks are analysed to produce MOVE, APPEAR, DISAPPEAR, CO_LOCATE, SEPARATE, and INTERACTION events
5. **Build graph** — Events and objects are assembled into an EGG graph (JSON)
6. **Export** — Graph is exported to Neo4j-ready CSVs and pushed to Neo4j Aura

### Assembly reasoning layer — industrial process understanding

7. **State facts** — Raw events and operations are lifted into time-scoped symbolic predicates (`holding(hand, lego)`, `released(lego)`, `co_held(a, b)`, …)
8. **Operation events** — Higher-level operations are inferred: PICK_UP, PUT_DOWN, HOLD, CONTACT, PLACE_ONTO_CANDIDATE, INSERT_CANDIDATE, ATTACH_CANDIDATE, …
9. **Workflow timeline** — Operation clusters are segmented into workflow phases (manipulation → hold → placement → idle, …)
10. **Subtask events** — Assembly subtasks (pick_up_part, insert_part, attach_part, …) are inferred from facts + operations + domain config
11. **Assembly graph** — A rich typed graph (objects, relation_facts, subtasks, subgoals, phases, constraints) integrates all layers
12. **Assembly review** — Symbolic reasoner answers queries: what step is active, what is achieved, what is blocked, likely next, full evidence traces

## Running a Session

### New capture

1. Place your Quest 3 capture folder at any path, e.g.:
   ```
   Quest_Capture/session_003/quest_capture/
   ```

2. Update `XR_Pipeline/configs/pipeline.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   raw_data_root: "../Quest_Capture/session_003/quest_capture"
   domain_config: configs/domain_lego.yaml   # or your own domain
   ```

3. Run all pipeline scripts from inside `XR_Pipeline/`:

   **Base pipeline:**
   ```bash
   cd XR_Pipeline

   python scripts/01_build_frame_manifest.py      --session session_003
   python scripts/02_validate_manifest.py         --session session_003
   python scripts/05_build_object_observations.py --session session_003
   python scripts/06_link_object_tracks.py        --session session_003
   python scripts/07_build_event_windows.py       --session session_003
   python scripts/08_generate_event_summaries.py  --session session_003
   python scripts/09_build_egg_graph.py           --session session_003
   python scripts/10_prune_egg_graph.py           --session session_003
   python scripts/11_export_neo4j_csv.py          --session session_003
   python scripts/14_import_neo4j.py              --session session_003
   ```

   **Assembly reasoning layer** (run after the base pipeline):
   ```bash
   python scripts/09b_build_scene_state_package.py  --session session_003
   python scripts/09c_build_state_facts.py          --session session_003
   python scripts/10b_build_operation_events.py     --session session_003
   python scripts/10c_build_workflow_timeline.py    --session session_003
   python scripts/10d_build_subtask_events.py       --session session_003
   python scripts/09d_build_assembly_state_package.py --session session_003
   python scripts/10e_build_assembly_graph.py       --session session_003
   python scripts/11b_build_assembly_review.py      --session session_003
   ```

4. Query in Neo4j Browser or run demo queries:
   ```bash
   python scripts/12_demo_queries.py --session session_003
   ```

Each session's output is fully isolated under `XR_Pipeline/data/processed/<session_id>/`.

## Data Format

Quest 3 captures must be a flat folder containing per-frame file triples:

```
quest_capture/
  frame_000001_<ticks>_640x480.rgba     # RGBA32 raw bytes
  frame_000001_<ticks>_depth.npy        # float32 depth in metres
  frame_000001_<ticks>_meta.json        # pose + dimensions
  frame_000002_<ticks>_640x480.rgba
  frame_000002_<ticks>_depth.npy
  frame_000002_<ticks>_meta.json
  ...
```

`meta.json` structure:
```json
{
  "frame_index": 1,
  "ticks": 639088157281460250,
  "pose": {
    "position": [x, y, z],
    "rotation_xyzw": [rx, ry, rz, rw]
  },
  "rgb": { "width": 640, "height": 480 },
  "depth": { "count": 204800 }
}
```

Frames without a matching `_depth.npy` are processed for detection but skipped during 3D backprojection.

---

## Object Detection Backends

### Grounding DINO (default)

Open-vocabulary zero-shot detection. Objects are defined in `object_vocabulary` (per-class prompts + role) or via `detection_prompt`.

```yaml
observations_source: grounding_dino
```

~700 MB, auto-downloaded from HuggingFace on first run.

### MM-Grounding-DINO

Trained on Objects365 + COCO + RefCOCO — better recall on small objects and hands.

```yaml
observations_source: mm_grounding_dino
```

~830 MB, auto-downloaded on first run.

### YOLOv8

Fast inference with a pretrained or fine-tuned YOLO model. Useful when a domain-specific model is available.

```yaml
observations_source: yolo
```

### Depth Blobs (fallback, no model required)

```yaml
observations_source: depth_blobs
```

Segments depth discontinuities as anonymous blobs. No model required — useful for quick pipeline validation.

### Multi-pass detection groups

To avoid token competition between object roles, define `detection_groups` in `pipeline.yaml`. Each enabled group runs as a separate detector pass with its own prompt and optionally its own thresholds:

```yaml
detection_groups:
  hands:
    enabled: true
    classes: ["hand"]
    box_threshold: 0.20
    text_threshold: 0.20
  workpieces:
    enabled: true
    classes: ["red_lego", "blue_lego"]
    box_threshold: 0.25
    text_threshold: 0.25
  tools:
    enabled: false
    classes: []
```

Isolated prompts significantly improve per-role recall (e.g. hand detection goes from ~26% to ~85% recall when run separately).

Detection overlays are saved to:
```
XR_Pipeline/data/processed/<session>/graphs/debug_boxes/frame_XXXXXX_detections.png
```

---

## Domain Configuration

Domain configs (`configs/domain_*.yaml`) separate domain-specific knowledge from generic pipeline logic. They define the object vocabulary, role assignments, enabled operations, and role pairings for a specific process — without any code changes.

Two example domains are provided: `domain_lego.yaml` and `domain_industrial_example.yaml`.

```yaml
# configs/domain_lego.yaml (excerpt)
domain_name: "lego_assembly"
domain_version: "1.0"

object_classes:
  - canonical: "red_lego"
    role: workpiece
  - canonical: "hand"
    role: hand

workflow_phases:
  - label: "hold"
    description: "Object held by hand"

enabled_operations:
  - HOLD
  - PICK_UP
  - PUT_DOWN
  - CONTACT
  - INSERT_CANDIDATE
  - ATTACH_CANDIDATE

role_pairings:
  - agent_role: hand
    patient_role: workpiece
    valid_operations: [HOLD, PICK_UP, PUT_DOWN]
  - agent_role: workpiece
    patient_role: workpiece
    valid_operations: [CONTACT, INSERT_CANDIDATE, ATTACH_CANDIDATE]
```

Set `domain_config` in `pipeline.yaml` to activate:

```yaml
domain_config: configs/domain_lego.yaml
```

---

## EGG Graph Structure

The base EGG (`egg_graph.json`) is stored as:

```
rooms[]
  └─ objects[]                     # each object track (persistent identity across frames)
       └─ time_variant_history[]   # per-frame 3D position + confidence
events[]                           # MOVE, APPEAR, DISAPPEAR, CO_LOCATE, SEPARATE, INTERACTION
event_edges[]                      # Event → Object role assignments
temporal_edges[]                   # Event → Event BEFORE relationships
```

### Base event types

| Type | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `APPEAR` | Object first observed in scene |
| `DISAPPEAR` | Object absent for N consecutive frames |
| `MOVE` | Object track displaces > `min_move_distance_m` |
| `CO_LOCATE` | Two objects come within `near_threshold_m` of each other |
| `SEPARATE` | Two previously near objects move apart |
| `INTERACTION` | `hands` track comes within `near_threshold_m` of another object |

### Operation-level events (assembly layer)

| Type | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `PICK_UP` | INTERACTION onset + workpiece MOVE shortly after |
| `PUT_DOWN` | Workpiece MOVE end + INTERACTION offset shortly after |
| `HOLD` | Sustained INTERACTION without significant workpiece displacement |
| `APPROACH` | Workpiece track converging toward a fixture over time |
| `CONTACT` | Two objects within contact threshold (CO_LOCATE or closer) |
| `TRANSFER` | Workpiece MOVE with no hand present |
| `USE_TOOL` | Tool-role object proximate to a workpiece for sustained frames |
| `PLACE_ONTO_CANDIDATE` | Workpiece MOVE endpoint within placement proximity of a fixture |
| `INSERT_CANDIDATE` | Workpiece MOVE endpoint within contact range of a fixture |
| `ALIGN_CANDIDATE` | Workpiece reaches alignment tolerance of a fixture without a full MOVE |
| `ATTACH_CANDIDATE` | Sustained contact between workpiece and fixture after a move |

Operations ending in `_CANDIDATE` carry partial evidence and are promoted when additional evidence is available.

---

## Assembly Reasoning Layer

The assembly reasoning stack sits on top of the EGG and turns sensor observations into symbolic assembly state — with no LLM calls and no model downloads.

### State facts (`state_facts.csv`)

Facts are time-scoped symbolic predicates derived from events and operations:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Presence | `present(obj)`, `appeared(obj)`, `disappeared(obj)` |
| Motion | `started_moving(obj)`, `stopped_moving(obj)` |
| Proximity | `near(a,b)`, `touching_candidate(a,b)` |
| Support state | `resting(obj)`, `carried(obj)`, `surface_contact(obj)` |
| Operation-derived | `holding(agent,obj)`, `released(obj)`, `in_contact(a,b)`, `inserted_into_candidate(a,b)`, `placed_on_candidate(a,b)`, `aligned_with_candidate(a,b)`, `attached_to_candidate(a,b)`, `used_tool_on(tool,obj)` |
| Inter-object | `co_held(a,b)`, `co_held_started(a,b)`, `co_held_ended(a,b)` |

Each fact has a status lifecycle: `candidate → active → achieved / invalidated`.

### Assembly graph (`assembly_graph.json`)

The assembly graph layers on top of the EGG with typed nodes and edges:

**Node types:** `object`, `relation_fact`, `subtask`, `subgoal`, `phase`, `constraint`

**Edge types:**

| Edge | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `involves` | subtask → object |
| `supports` | fact → subtask (evidence) |
| `achieves` | subtask → subgoal |
| `requires` | subtask → constraint |
| `depends_on` | subtask_B → subtask_A (ordering) |
| `evidence_for` | operation → subtask |
| `next_candidate` | subtask_A → subtask_B (likely sequence) |
| `belongs_to_phase` | subtask → phase |

### Assembly reasoner (symbolic, no LLM)

The reasoner (`assembly_reasoner.py`) answers structured queries over the assembly state package:

| Query | Returns |
|-------|---------|
| `what_step_now` | Most recent active or candidate subtask |
| `what_is_achieved` | All achieved subgoals + their evidence chains |
| `what_is_blocked` | Blocked subtasks + unmet dependencies |
| `what_changed` | Facts/subtasks with `start_frame` in the last N frames |
| `likely_next` | Pending subtasks whose prerequisites are all met |
| `why_current_step` | Evidence chain for the active subtask |
| `state_transitions` | Released / support_changed / co_held timeline |
| `what_objects_related` | Inter-object pairwise relations (co_held, in_contact, …) |
| `full_report` | All of the above in one dict |

---

## Neo4j Import

Script `14_import_neo4j.py` pushes data directly to Neo4j Aura via the Bolt driver — no manual CSV upload needed.

```bash
cd XR_Pipeline
python scripts/14_import_neo4j.py --session session_003
```

It will:
1. Connect using credentials from `.env`
2. Clear all existing data for that session's room
3. Import rooms, objects, events, and all relationships
4. Print a summary of nodes and edges created

### Graph schema in Neo4j

```
(:Room)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Object)
(:Event)-[:INVOLVES {role}]->(:Object)
(:Event)-[:BEFORE]->(:Event)
```

Node labels: `Room`, `Object`, `Event`

---

## Example Queries

Run these in the [Neo4j Browser](https://browser.neo4j.io) after importing.

```cypher
-- All event types and counts
MATCH (e:Event) RETURN e.event_type, count(*) ORDER BY count(*) DESC

-- Full interaction timeline (what did the hands touch and when?)
MATCH (e:Event {event_type:"INTERACTION"})-[:INVOLVES {role:"target_object"}]->(o)
RETURN round(toFloat(e.start_ts_ns)/1e9, 2) AS sec, o.semantic_class, e.summary
ORDER BY e.start_ts_ns

-- Sequence of events in the first 30 seconds
MATCH (e:Event)
WHERE e.start_ts_ns <= 30000000000
WITH e ORDER BY e.start_ts_ns
MATCH (e)-[:INVOLVES]->(o:Object)
RETURN e.event_type, e.summary, o.semantic_class,
       round(toFloat(e.start_ts_ns)/1e9, 2) AS time_sec
ORDER BY e.start_ts_ns

-- Objects co-located and what happened next
MATCH (e1:Event {event_type:"CO_LOCATE"})-[:INVOLVES]->(a:Object)
MATCH (e1)-[:INVOLVES]->(b:Object)
WHERE a.track_id < b.track_id
OPTIONAL MATCH (e1)-[:BEFORE]->(e2:Event)
RETURN a.semantic_class, b.semantic_class, e1.summary, e2.event_type, e2.summary

-- Subgraph: hands and everything it touched (switch to Graph view in Browser)
MATCH (e:Event {event_type:"INTERACTION"})-[:INVOLVES]->(n)
RETURN e, n
```

## IndustReal Pipeline

`IndustReal_Pipeline/` is a standalone sub-pipeline for the [IndustReal](https://github.com/TimSchoonbeek/IndustReal) benchmark dataset — a HoloLens 2 recording of a bolt assembly task.

It ports the IndustReal PSR (Procedure Step Recognition) algorithms (B1, B2, B3) and wraps their output in an EGG-style graph for uniform querying.

### Running the IndustReal demo

```bash
cd IndustReal_Pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/01_run_demo.py
```

### Architecture

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `src/data_loader.py` | Load IndustReal clips and procedure info |
| `src/psr.py` | PSR algorithms B1, B2, B3 (pure Python, no C extensions) |
| `src/egg_builder.py` | Convert PSR step predictions into EGG-style `StateEvent` + `AssemblyGraph` |

The `AssemblyGraph` produced here uses the same event taxonomy as the XR Pipeline (INSTALL, REMOVE, ERROR, CORRECT) and tracks final component states across the recording.
